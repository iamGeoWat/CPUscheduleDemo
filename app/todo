when get in the degrees
if ram is enough && any degree is empty
    find big enough hole start from os_end to ram_end(15000)
    allocate;
    get in degrees

when get out cpu
    update inUseTable
    bind newly emptied ram with existed hole

when suspend
    move it out of the ram
    update inUseTable
    bind newly emptied ram with existed hole

when de-suspend
    find big enough hole start from os_end to ram_end(15000)
    allocate;
    toggleSuspend();
